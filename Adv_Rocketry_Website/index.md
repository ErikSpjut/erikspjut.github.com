## Learning Outcomes
* Students will demonstrate fundamental competence in four areas of aerospace engineering
* Students will demonstrate deep knowledge in one of the four areas of aerospace engineering
* Students will demonstrate the ability to plan and conduct a successful flight program to answer specific questions in aerospace engineering

## Course Structure

### Four two-week intensive experiences in four aspects of rocketry chosen from:

#### Flight dynamics and modeling
* Fluid mechanics and CFD
* Dynamic equations of motion

#### Structural dynamics and modeling

#### Avionics
* Telemetry
* Sensors and signal conditioning
* Kalman filtering and signal processing
	
#### Risk and reliability

#### Propulsion

### Final Project of six weeks duration.
* One or more flights of a rocket into the supersonic region
* Flight analysis must include the four areas of aerospace engineering addressed in the first part of the course
* Flight analysis must be in-depth in one of the four areas
	
## Support

### Learning Modules and/or videos in the areas of aerospace engineering

### Flight hardware and software that permits a fundamental competence in the four areas, specifically default versions of
* Rocket – 38mm thin-wall fiberglass capable of supersonic flights, Detailed assembly instructions
* Propulsion – set of solid propellant rocket motors and casings for supersonic flight
* Avionics – System with following capabilities: Dual deploy; accelerometers, rate gyros, pressure altimeter, GPS for IMU/trajectory; GPS tracking; Telemetry of all data.
* Reference design of Teensy-based avionics system
* Flight dynamics – software and models for flight modeling of class rocket
* Signal processing – Working Kalman filter for default flight avionics and analysis of default flight data
* Structural dynamics – Setup for tap testing of default flight hardware

### Students are expected to use default version for most aspects of their project, but are required to use a custom version for their in-depth topic.

#### Sample in-depth designs:
* Lower body tube with custom sets of fins
* Custom instrumentation and sensors such as telemetry system, vibration measurement system, etc.
* Custom signal-processing software
* System for active stabilization (not guidance)
