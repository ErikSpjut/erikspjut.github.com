My hobbies include music, composition, reading, writing, gaming, and game design. If I ever get
enough time, I'll spend some of it trying out new ways to design games
and explore interactive computing entertainment. Here are a couple
things I've done.

## Wizard Fight Race 7II
Starting at 9:30 am on March 15, 2012, for about 72 hours, I led a
small group of 4 total contributors in creating a simple arcade-style
hack-and-slash game using the Unity3D game engine. You can [read about
the project](https://sites.google.com/site/72hourgame), [download the
game](https://sites.google.com/site/72hourgame/download), or even
[play it using a web
plugin](https://sites.google.com/site/72hourgame/download/current-build).

Note: The following links haven't been fixed since CIS broke my old web space...

There is also a mostly working [Chrome version](http://www3.hmc.edu/~jspjut/WFR72_Chrome) to try. You
  probably want to right click and choose full screen to be able to
  use right click for abilities in the game.
Finally I have an experimental [Android APK](http://www3.hmc.edu/~jspjut/WFR_Android.apk), though it mostly
  doesn't work due to controls being not yet implemented for the platform.

## PyGauntlet
As part of a group project as an undergrad we designed a game very
similar to the hack and slash game Gauntlet. I released the source
code on google code and continue to work on it from time to time. It
can be found at
its [google code page](http://code.google.com/p/pygauntlet).
I developed the OpenGL rendering front end on my own after the initial
project was finished.
