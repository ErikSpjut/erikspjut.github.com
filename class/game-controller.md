Students in this course will build the own game controller from
scratch capable of providing input to a variety of PC games. The
course includes instruction on resistors, switches and using Arduino
to behave as a USB keyboard and mouse.

#Overview

This course introduces some concepts of basic resistor circuits and
how they can be read by a microcontroller using an analog to digital
converter. 
In particular, we will look at the use of joystick potentiometers as a
standard sensor element for game controllers as well as tactile
buttons combined with pull-up or pull-down resistors to provide
digital inputs.
Additionally, Arduino software will be developed to treat the
joysticks, buttons and switches as standard USB keyboard and mouse
input that can be used for PC games.
With the rapid increase of maker culture and do-it-yourself projects
in recent years, this course provides an easy introduction to circuits
and microcontrollers for the uninitiated and allows more advanced
students the chance to tune the hardware and software to customize the
user experience.
