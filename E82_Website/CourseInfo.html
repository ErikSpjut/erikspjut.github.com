Phase and reaction equilibria will be presented.Application to power cycles and chemical reactor design will be made.</p><h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2><p>The goals of an engineering education should be: to supplyyou with a fundamental set of concepts and practices upon whichengineering is built, and with which you can build an intellectualframework for the additional knowledge which you will undoubtedly need,to help you distinguish between what you know and what you don't know,to give you practice in educating yourself with whatever knowledge isnecessary to solve the problem at hand, and to communicate clearly toothers what the problem is and how to solve it.</p><p>This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of chemical andthermal processes, to help you distinguish between what you know andwhat you don't know, to give you practice in educating yourself withwhatever knowledge is necessary to solve the problem at hand, and tocommunicate clearly to others what the problem is and how to solve it.Toward this end, there are the following course components:</p><h2>Course Components</h2>	<h3>Homework</h3>	<p>The homework will usually be assigned by email to theclass list and also listed on the website. Homework will not be submitted for grading (with oneexception). However, students will be chosen pseudo-randomly to presenthomework solutions for each problem in class. In addition to thesolution, the presenting student will be expected to describe thefundamental principles needed to solve the problem, and how the problemapplies in a larger engineering context.</p><p>Each presentation will be graded for technical content (by me), and forutility and clarity of presentation (by the other students). Studentswill not be given advance notice of the day they are to present. If youare not present on the day you are asked to present, you will receive azero, unless you have informed me ahead of time (e.g., clinic or othertrip), or your absence is due to a serious documentable cause (e.g.,illness, earthquake, family tragedy). Students will be emailed theirpresentation grades as soon as they are available.</p><p>To be successful in this class, you must start on your homework early.There are often missing parameters or approaches that are not in thebook, nor in the class notes. You are expected to find the missingmaterial. You can often find it by asking me in person or by email, butyou won't know what to ask until you start on the homework. People whowait until the night before will almost certainly be unable to finish.</p><h3>Computer Assignments</h3><p>There will be a computer assignment due eachweek. For the first twelve weeks, the assignments will be on MicrosoftExcel and will be submitted electronically. There will be templates foreach of the spreadsheet assignments available on the course website. Forthe last three weeks, the assignments will probably be on a commercialprocess flow simulator, and will probably be turned in as annotatedprintouts.</p><h3>Quizzes</h3><p>Pop quizzes may be given at any time during class. Theywill be short (5-to-10 minutes) and on a single concept or idea.</p><h3>Exams</h3><p>Three mid-term examinations and one final examination willbe given. They will be open-book and open-note. The exams will consistof two sections: A series of short, single-topic questions, andseveral deeper questions. The short-question section must becompleted during the assigned testing period, but the deeper-questionsection may be completed anytime during a 24-hour period commencing withthe start of the short-question period.</p><p>The purpose of the short-question section is to test for a minimalcompetency in chemical and thermal processes. A list of exactly whatconcept or principle is being tested by each short question will beprovided before the exam. Except for plugging in the numerical values,you can (and should) prepare complete solutions for the short questionsbefore the exam. You must pass 70 percent of the short questions on eachexam to pass the course. A student passing fewer than 70 percent of thequestions on a given exam will have one week from the time the exams arereturned to schedule and pass an oral examination on the same subjects,if they wish to remain in the class. Anyone failing an oral examinationwill fail the course.</p><p>The deeper questions are designed to test for the ability to integrateand synthesize several basic skills in the solution of an engineeringproblem. Exam problems from previous years will be included in thehomework. There will be no extra review sessions scheduled outside ofclass before the exams.</p><h2>Grading</h2><p>The weighting of assessed material will be as follows:</p><table>	<tr>		<td>HW/Presentations</td> <td>25%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Computer Assignments</td> <td>20%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Quizzes</td> <td>5%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Midterms</td> <td>30%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Final</td> <td>20%</td>	</tr></table></body></html>
