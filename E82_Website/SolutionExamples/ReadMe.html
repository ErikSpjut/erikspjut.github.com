The intent of the project was to provide solutions to problems in Felder and Rousseau, 2nd Edition, which presented both solution techniques and software tutorials. The problem numbers correspond to the numbers in F&amp;R 2nd. Ed., but the problem statements are included in the .pdf files, so a copy of F&amp;R is not needed. </body></html>
