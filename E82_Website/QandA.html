I am still being able to do the problems, but without any sort of lecture notes it is getting harder and harder - we don't have anything to reference. (the online notes are very confusing, and the book is unnecessarily complex; I'm not a very good book learner). It would be really helpful just to have some general formulas and methods for approaching these problems rather than just throwing us into them and seeing if we sink or swim. It strikes me that the only time I Learn something in class is when I Don't do the homework - otherwise I just watch people stumble through problems on the board that I have already grappled with, and see nothing new.</p><p>If we could step back from the individual problems and look for a generalized method, I think that would really help a lot of people. Thanks.</p><h1>Answer</h1><p>Please come in and talk with me. My intent is to spend whatever time is necessaryto explain whatever individual students don't understand. In other words, I'm willing togive personal lectures to individuals or small groups for people who are not necessarilygood book learners. Don't just struggle in the dark. Come in and see me. You have between9 and 12 hours per week (including class time) to devote to class. If you spend three inclass, you can devote one or two to talking with me and have between four and eight leftto do the homework</p><p>Clearly, if you didn't understand how to do the problem, coming to class would behelpful. But if you DO understand the problem, you should be actively participatingin the class discussion, so that we all end up with deeper insights.</p><p>When you leave Mudd, you will often have occasion to educate yourself on whateverthe boss needs you to be an expert in. Sometimes there will be a short course youcan take, but most of the time, you'll have to study, figure out what you don't know,and then find someone to ask, who can explain it to you. That's the intent here, withme being the one to ask.</p><p>I'm happy to discuss generalized methods. Come in and see me.</p></body></html>
