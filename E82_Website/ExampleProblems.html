He's somewhat puzzled by the following order from Zero Zalinski's Groceryand Karioke Bar: We need apples and bananas. The number of bananas should equal the number ofapples. The number of each should be multiplied by the number of apples, and the square of thenumber of bananas should be subtracted from both results. How large of a truck should Freddieschedule?</p><h1>Problem 2</h1><p>Eunice must program the computer in an automobile which controls the display of the velocity.The input is the output from the new Enermeas sensor which gives a very repeatable value fora given velocity. The engineering team believes the the output from the Enermeas is a quadraticfunction of the velocity. Eunice did a regression of the Output vs v data and determined thatthe relationship between output and velocity is</p><p>Out = v<sup>2</sup> - 2v + 3.</p><p>Two of the data points were Out = 2, v = 1, and Out = 3, v = 2. Can Eunice's formula be correct? Whatis the minimum number of points needed to determine if the functional form is wrong? If her formulais correct, what is the velocity for an Output of 27?</p></body></html>
