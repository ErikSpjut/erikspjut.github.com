## Consulting

I have consulted for a wide variety of companies and organizations in the following areas:

* Development and Automation of Experiments and Experimental Equipment
  * Design and construction of three-color pyrometer
  * Design and construction of electrodynamic and electrostatic levitators
    

* Modeling and Design for Radiant Heat Transfer
  * Modeling of Si wafer processing furnace
  * Modeling of thin film on glass processing furnace
    
    
* Analysis and Design of Experiments
  * Use Design of Experiments to determine parameter space for novel triboelectric separation process
    
    
* Single and Multiphase Fluid Flow
  * Develop spreadsheet for use by company engineers to estimate pressure drops in
    aircraft fire extinguisher circuits
  * Determine cause of flow instability in two-phase system and develop a simple
    method to stabilize the Flow
    
* LabVIEW Development

## Special Projects

While not directly sponsored research or course development, I've done a number of special
projects in connection with curriculum development, consulting, research, or my own enjoyment

* Development of digital filters for CSound
* Video production
* Audio production and podcasting

## Research

My research interests include Heterogeneous Kinetics, Radiative Heat Transfer,
Containerless Processing, Process Control, and Automation of Laboratory
equipment.
I advise the [Charlab](http://charlab.github.io/) research group.
