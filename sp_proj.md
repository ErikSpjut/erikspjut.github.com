## Special Projects

While not directly sponsored research or course development, I've done a number of special
projects in connection with curriculum development, consulting, research, or for my own enjoyment

* Custom PC boards for high power and model rocketry
  * Analog Inertial Measurement Units, [IMU2, 3, & 4](http://www.eng.hmc.edu/NewE80/AccelGyroLab.html#IMU)
  * PC board with breadboard layout and data logger socket for quick rugged prototyping
  of flight-ready sensor packages
  * Signal conditioning board for Dytran triple-axis accelerometers.
* Launch controllers and stands for high power and model rocketry
* Video production (scripting, filming, scoring, editing, and post-production)
  * I co-wrote, directed, videoed, edited, wrote and recorded the scores for the following videos:
      * [Mill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFo0GglDMnM) I have since used Engineering Clinic funds to
      modernize the shop and get new mills.
      * [Lathe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QHicKtTjQw)
      * [Wood Shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut8CQeE8qIw)
      * [Sheet Metal Shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPg_AsD3wVg)
	* I used some of my footage and a lot of other people's footage to put together the following videos:
		* [Rocket Flight Safety Video 1](http://youtu.be/broUGIMpHnU)
		* [Rocket Flight Safety Video 2](http://youtu.be/mgLIqtVhB50)
		* All of the videos on [this page](http://www.eng.hmc.edu/NewE80/FlightVideos.html). The videos are
		all in Quicktime format. You must have the Quicktime plugin in your web browser to
		view them online. If you don't, the videos will download instead of playing.
* Audio production and podcasting (songwriting and composing, recording, editing, and post-production)
	* I did the recording, engineering, editing, and wrote most of the commercials for the
	Adolph in Space podcasts. They are available on iTunes (search for PAFLY) or [here](http://www.pafly.com/radio/).
	The first three were done back in the old analog days. Episodes 4-9 were done with
	modern DAW tools.
	* I've written, recorded and produced two different full-length albums.
		* [East High Anthology](https://soundcloud.com/heerret/sets/east-high-anthology). [Lyrics and Notes](/easthighanth.html) The songs were about the trauma and joy of my high-school days
		at East High in Salt Lake. Yes, it was where HSM 1, 2, & 3 were filmed. In fact
		we performed _A Man of Few Words_ on the same stage where Troy and Gabriella
		performed _Breaking Free_.
		* [Here's Mudd in Yer I](https://soundcloud.com/heerret/sets/heres-mudd-in-yer-i).
		_Who Wants an "A"_ and the four E59 pieces were
		all commissioned as incidental music for the E59 class. The others were written for
		various other projects at Harvey Mudd
* Digital audio algorithms, coding, and processing
* Development of digital filters for CSound
