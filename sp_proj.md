  * Analog Inertial Measurement Units, [IMU2, 3, & 4](http://www.eng.hmc.edu/NewE80/AccelGyroLab.html#IMU)
  * PC board with breadboard layout and data logger socket for quick rugged prototyping
  of flight-ready sensor packages
  * Signal conditioning board for Dytran triple-axis accelerometers.
* Launch controllers and stands for high power and model rocketry
* Video production (scripting, filming, scoring, editing, and post-production)
* Audio production and podcasting (songwriting and composing, recording, editing, and post-production)
