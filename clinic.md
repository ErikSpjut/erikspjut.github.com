## Engineering Clinic
The Engineering Clinic Program started in 1963. It is a sponsored Third-/Fourth-Year capstone project course.
A good deal of information can be found [here](https://www.hmc.edu/clinic/).
A brief history can be found [here](https://www.hmc.edu/clinic/history-of-the-clinic-program/). Clinic 
has grown from its start in Engineering to include Computer Science, Physics, Math, and a
Global Program. The concept of Clinic has been copied widely but was radically different 
from the prevailing engineering pedagogy in 1963.

Each student-led project has a Faculty Advisor who is a coach or a mentor to the team,
and not a typical Principal Investigator. However, the Faculty Advisor typically learns
as much as the students do about the sponsor and the project. I've put both information about
my time as Engineering Clinic Director and about the projects for which I've been the Faculty Advisor.

## Engineering Clinic Director
From July 2010 to July 2015 I was the Engineering Clinic Director. The Engineering Clinic Director's
primary responsibility is recruiting of Clinic Projects for the students. The total number
of projects required varies from year to year depending on the number of Engineering Majors.
During my time the count in Engineering varied between 20 and 26. The total annual budget
for the Engineering Clinic Program is in excess of $1,000,000. I am happy to discuss the details
of the budgeting on an individual basis.

Barry Olsan, the Director of Corporate Relations initiates contact with most of the sponsors.
Once he has a potential sponsor willing to either meet or or have a teleconference, the
Engineering Clinic Director gets involved for the site visit or teleconference. A good
fraction of my time was spent on site visits and teleconferences. The Clinic Director 
helps the sponsors edit the project statements and get the business agreement in place.
The Clinic Director then assigns the students and the Faculty Advisors to the teams, and
deals with the logistics.

I had the great benefit of having [David Harris](http://pages.hmc.edu/harris/)
as the Associate Director for the first two
years, [Qimin Yang](https://www.hmc.edu/about-hmc/hmc-experts/yang-qimin/)
as the Associate Director for the next two years, and [Lori Bassman](http://pages.hmc.edu/bassman/) as
the Associate Director for the final year. My job would have been impossible without the support
of Lorena Gonzalez, the Engineering Clinic Program Coordinator, and the rest of the
Engineering support staff.

My time as Engineering Clinic Director gave me both practice at and great insight
into what it takes to manage a $1,000,000 program.

## Clinics I've Advised
Again, the Faculty Advisor  is a coach or a mentor to the team,
and not a  Principal Investigator. Nevertheless, I've learned a great deal from the projects I've
advised and I've learned a lot more engineering than I otherwise would have.
