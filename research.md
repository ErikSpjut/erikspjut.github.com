## Research Areas
As of late, I have pursued active learning as applied to engineering. To support my principal laboratory for active learning, the rocketry-based Engineering Laboratory course, I have also pursued inertial measurement and Kalman filtering, vibrational system ID, the physics of rocket flight, MEMS and other sensors, data acquisition and error analysis.

I was also recently involved in the engineering of an adaptive-optics retrofit to the Table Mountain telescope operated by Pomona College. My principal areas were the structural integrity and vibration isolation.

My previous research was principally in the area of high-temperature processing of materials — both in fundamental science and engineering applications. My primary thrust was in heterogeneous reaction kinetics and diagnostics. Specific areas of research were the intrinsic and overall kinetics of solid or liquid aerosols reacting at high temperatures with a gas, e.g., carbon combustion, metal-oxide formation, carburization and metal-carbide formation, gaseous reduction of metal oxides and oxidation of metal sulfides. The morphologies of the products and of the solid reactants as controlled by the reaction kinetics are also of interest.

As an adjunct to the materials research, I have pursued the areas of containerless processing of materials, non-contact temperature measurement, computer-controlled experimental design, radiative scattering, absorption and emission from metallic and non-metallic aerosols, tribocharging and charge stability on heated aerosols, and supercooling of metals and ceramics. In addition, process-sensors and feedback-control are of great interest to me.
